PROBLEM STATEMENT : An image smoother is a filter of the size 3 x 3 that can be applied to each cell of an image by rounding down the average of the cell and the eight surrounding cells
(i.e., the average of the nine cells in the blue smoother).
If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, we do not consider it in the average (i.e., the average of the four cells in the red smoother).
CODE:
class Solution {
    public int[][] imageSmoother(int[][] img) {
        int m = img.length; 
        int n = img[0].length; 
        int[][] result = new int[m][n]; 
        int[] directions = {-1, 0, 1}; 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = img[i][j]; 
                int count = 1; // Start with 1 for the current cell
                
                for (int dx : directions) {
                    for (int dy : directions) {
                        int ni = i + dx;
                        int nj = j + dy;
                        // Only count valid neighbors that are within bounds
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n && (dx != 0 || dy != 0)) {
                            sum += img[ni][nj];
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
                result[i][j] = sum / count; // Average (rounded down)
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
